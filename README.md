# 🧠 Face Identification & Attendance System

This is a Streamlit-based application that uses [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) to recognize faces either from a **camera** or **uploaded image** and mark attendance to a CSV file. You can also view attendance records from a separate page.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Take photos directly from your webcam  
- 🧑‍🔬 Face recognition using DeepFace and a custom image database  
- 📝 Attendance marking with name, date, and time  
- 📊 Live attendance viewer page  
- 🔐 No internet required after setup

## 📁 Adding Known Faces

- Create subfolders inside `known_faces/`, each named after the person.
- Place one or more clear face images inside each folder.

**Example:**
```
known_faces/  
├── Elon_Musk/  
│   └── 1.jpg  
├── Taylor_Swift/  
│   └── 1.jpg  
```

## 📸 Camera Support

Streamlit's `st.camera_input()` is used for capturing images directly from webcam. This works only in a **web browser**, not in mobile or desktop Streamlit apps.

---

## 📊 Attendance Output

Attendance is recorded in a `attendance.csv` file in this format:

Name | Date | Time  
-----|------|------  
Elon_Musk | 2025-06-12 | 10:32:14
